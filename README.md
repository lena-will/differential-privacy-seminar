## Differential Privacy in Economics
This repository holds the code to my seminar project on differential privacy in economics.
The file `info-utility.ipynb` has the code to the bisection method (via `scipy`) that numerically finds the root of a function. It's used to find the optimal $\epsilon*$ for differntial private algorithms when equating the MRT and the MRS as described by Abowd and Schmute (2019).
